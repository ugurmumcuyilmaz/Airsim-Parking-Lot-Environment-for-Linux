Airsim Parking Lot Environment for Linux (For both vertical and parallel parking)


For those interested in Microsoft AirSim and working on autonomous vehicles, I have created a new environment in addition to the limited existing ones. These two different environments are designed for specific tasks: one for vertical parking and the other for parallel parking. During this process, I would like to thank the 3D Warehouse user "MelteM Hethiter" for their contribution. I utilized and further developed their design, which can be found at the following link: "https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/21d8b003-14c3-4fb1-bce9-4db451bc8bf3/City".

The usage of this project is the same as how you use environments on the Microsoft AirSim page. Please note that this is specifically for Linux.
